# Rust Development with Docker

This repository provides a Docker-based development environment for Rust. It
allows you to write and run Rust programs without having to install the Rust
toolchain on your local machine. All you need is Docker and Docker Compose.

## Prerequisites

- Docker: You can download it from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
- Docker Compose: It's included in the Docker desktop installations for Windows
  and Mac. For Linux, you can follow the instructions on the [official Docker Compose installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
